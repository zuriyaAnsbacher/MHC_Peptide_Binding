Like 'HLA(CNN)_Pep(lstm)_FC_2out_concat1hot_18|1|22.txt' (in Script, Hyper-parameters, Data file)

But with theses differences:

    In the hyper-parameters:
    add concat_emb_dim=20 (explained below)

    In Model details:
    Instead of using concat one-hot to the encoded HLA+pep, I added embedding vector.
    It is similar to the one-hot in that we use the 30 most common HLA-A, but instead of convert them to one-hot,
    I convert them to an embedding vector (dim=20, vocabulary size is 31 (30 to the common HLA-A and another to the other HLA-A)
