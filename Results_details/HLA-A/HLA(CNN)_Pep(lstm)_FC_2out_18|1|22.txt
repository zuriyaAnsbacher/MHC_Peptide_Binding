Like 'HLA(CNN)_Pep(lstm)_FC_2out_concat1hot_18|1|22.txt' (in Script, Hyper-parameters, Data file)
But different in the Model details: without the addition of the one-hot concat
(so actually, the model is like in 'HLA(CNN)_Pep(lstm)_FC_2outputs_13|1|22.txt')

I run it because I wanted to compare between the results of the model with concat one-hot, and without,
and I needed to do the comparison on same datafile.

Results:
    Num epochs: 250 / 250
    auc test:  0.9008  |  r2 test:  0.2709

Path to results:
