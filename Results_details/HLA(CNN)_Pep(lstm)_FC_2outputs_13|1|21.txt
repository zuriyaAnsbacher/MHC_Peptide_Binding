    HLA_Pep_model_2outputs.py

Hyper-parameters:
    batch size: 50
    epochs: 250
    optimizer: Adam. parameters: only fc layers after the AEs
    loss functions:
        F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits
        F.mse_loss
    alpha (coefficient to linear combination of loss functions): 0.5
    counter of early stopping: 30
    train size: 68% (0.8 * 0.85)
    val size: 12% (0.8 * 0.15)
    test size: 20%

Model details:
    Pep sequences were inserted to trained model: AE_lstm.
        (Its details are in 'AE_lstm_Pep_2|12|21.txt'.
        Model was loaded from: 'HLA-A_CNN_Results/CNN_version2/cnn_embedding=15_encoding=50.pt')
    HLA sequences were inserted to trained model: AE_CNN.
        (Its details are in 'AE_CNN_HLA_8|12|21.txt'.
        Model was loaded from: 'Pep_LSTM_Results/LSTM_last_output_1_layer_and_fc_lr=0.001_without_regularization/lstm_model_encoding_dim=20.pt')

    Then, the encoded sequences of HLA and pep were concatenated and insert to FC layers:
        self.fc1 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(self.encoding_dim_pep + self.encoding_dim_hla, 32),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.1),
        )
        self.fc2A = nn.Linear(32, 1)
        self.fc2B = nn.Linear(32, 1)

        2 last fc (fc2A, fc2B) are required because the model return 2 outputs: one is binary, one is continuous.
        They are applied in parallel, and no one by one.
        The first output should be with sigmoid, but because the loss function contains sigmoid, we do not put it in net.

    (Original file: mhc_ligand_full_05.csv)
    Processing done by:
        - filtered by: Linear peptide, Homo sapiens (in Host column, not Epitope (unlike the previous models))
        - peptides: remove artificial addition ('OVYLVMEL + OX(6M)' -> 'OVYLVMEL')
        - peptides length: 7-11
        - split each sample that has 2 classifications: binary and continuous, to 2 samples (one binary, one continuous)
        - create negative samples randomly. ratio of ~ 66% positive, 33% negative
    Finally, contains 168174 pairs of pep-hla. 167382 with binary labels, and 792 with continuous.
