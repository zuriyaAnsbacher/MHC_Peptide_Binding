Like 'version1_invalid/Description_21|12|21.txt' with these changes:


Create Sampler (SamplerByLength) such that the model will be able to get peptides with variable length.
The sampler creates batches, and each batch contains peptides with same length.

Data file:
    mhc_pep05_15perc_neg_PepLen7_11.csv.csv

    Peptides with variable length: 7-11
    positive-negative ratio: ~75% pos, ~15% neg

    Contains 132314 samples

Results:
    Num epochs: 250 / 250
    Test auc: 0.8983
